# üëã Welcome

This is the GitHub organisation of the `biocypher` project, an ecosystem to
facilitate building and using biomedical knowledge graphs and Large Language
Models (LLMs). We are an inclusive and multi-cultural team interested in making
knowledge graph creation more effective and accessible. Find us at
https://biocypher.org and https://biochatter.org, including docs and tutorials.

The main projects in the ecosystem are
[BioCypher](https://github.com/biocypher/biocypher) itself, a modular framework
for knowledge graph creation, and
[BioChatter](https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter), a similarly modular
framework for the connection of knowledge graphs and bioinformatics methods to
Large Language Models and their related technologies. A demonstration of the
ecosystem's capabilities can be seen in our web apps [BioChatter
Light](https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter-light) and [BioChatter
Next](https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter-next), which are available
[online](https://chat.biocypher.org). You can also experiment with a local
integration of a BioCypher knowledge graph with the BioChatter Light app using
the [POLE dataset demo repository](https://github.com/biocypher/pole).

One of our aims is to facilitate implementation of the
[FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and
[TRUST](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0486-7) principles in the
workflows related to the building of knowledge graphs and using LLMs in
biomedical tasks. We aim to do so by providing modular architectures, allowing
extensions in the areas of input (representing knowledge resources), ontology
(for harmonisation and machine readability), output (to allow adoption of the
most effective format for each task), language models, and auxiliary strategies
for task facilitation.

# üîå Adapters 

You can find an overview of our adapters and pipelines on the [Components
Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/biocypher/projects/3/views/2). For more
convenient browsing, you can also check out the
[meta-graph](https://github.com/biocypher/meta-graph)). If you create something
yourself, or are planning to, please get in touch, so we can keep this board
updated for everyone! 

# üåà Contribution Guidelines

> **Imposter syndrome disclaimer:** We want your help. No, really. There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready, that you aren't skilled enough to contribute. We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong. Most importantly, there are many valuable ways to contribute besides writing code.
