# üëã Welcome

This is the GitHub organisation of the `biocypher` project, a framework to build biomedical knowledge graphs. We are an inclusive and multi-cultural team interested in making knowledge graph creation more effective and accessible. Find us at https://biocypher.org, including docs and tutorials.

# üîå Adapters 

You can find an overview of our adapters and pipelines on the [Components Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/biocypher/projects/3/views/2). If you create something yourself, please get in touch, so we can keep this board updated for everyone!

# üåà Contribution Guidelines

We welcome all contributions of any kind. Please check out our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/biocypher/biocypher/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you want to ask informal questions, talk about dev things, or just chat, please join our community at https://biocypher.zulipchat.com!

> **Imposter syndrome disclaimer:** We want your help. No, really. There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready, that you aren't skilled enough to contribute. We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong. Most importantly, there are many valuable ways to contribute besides writing code.
